Theological Jurisprudence: The Contextual Application of *Lex Talionis*
=======================================================================

**A Formal Statement on the Biblical Mandate for Justice and Self-Defense**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *MDiv, JD, JSD* *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

This statement clarifies the theological and legal application of the biblical mandate found in Matthew 5:38-39 ("turn the other cheek") versus the standard of *lex talionis* ("an eye for an eye"). It asserts that the instruction to offer non-resistance is a specific command for complying with **"Prison Rules"**, as evidenced by the contextual timeline of John the Baptist's imprisonment at Machaerus. Conversely, for free societies and sovereign militaries facing hostile invading forces, the principle of "an eye for an eye" remains the necessary standard of justice.

**I. The Context of Captivity: Matthew 4:12**
---------------------------------------------

To understand the Sermon on the Mount, one must understand the specific location and political reality in which the preceding events occurred.

> *"And having heard that Yoḥanan had been put in prison, He withdrew into Galil."* --- **Mattithyahu (Matthew) 4:12 (The Scriptures 1998)**

The ministry of Jesus (Yahusha) shifts gears immediately following the arrest of John (Yoḥanan) the Baptist. John was imprisoned at **Machaerus**, which is located in Jordan. **Jordan is not a hostile invading force; it is a nation of the Hebrew people.**

### **The Prison Protocol**

When Jesus instructs, *"But I say to you, do not resist the wicked. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also"* (Matt 5:39), He is providing a survival mechanism for those incarcerated within their own legal or community structure. He is saying: **"Follow prison rules."**

-   **Incarceration Dynamics:** In a prison setting, resistance against guards often leads to immediate severe punishment. "Turning the cheek" is a tactical submission to preserve life while held by a domestic authority.

-   **Not for Invaders:** Jesus is **NOT** saying "Turn the other cheek" when you are held captive by a hostile occupying force. He is strictly addressing the conduct of a prisoner under specific jurisdictional confinement.

**II. The Normal Rule of Law:** ***Lex Talionis***
--------------------------------------------------

For a free people facing an outsider, a terrorist, or a hostile occupying force, the biblical and natural law standard is **Reciprocity**.

> *"You heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,'"* --- **Mattithyahu (Matthew) 5:38 (The Scriptures 1998)**

**The occupying force gets the** ***Lex Talionis*****.**

### **The Necessity of Equalization**

When a military or community allows an outsider to kill or harm their members without equalization, the members become prey.

-   **Deterrence:** The law of "an eye for an eye" is not about revenge; it is about **restraint** and **protection**. It ensures that the punishment matches the crime.

-   **Protection of the Flock:** A shepherd who allows wolves to eat the sheep without retaliation is not "turning the other cheek"; he is derelict in his duty. The military serves as the shepherd. To protect the innocent from invasion, the aggressor must be met with equal or greater force.

**III. Theological Application for the Corrections System**
-----------------------------------------------------------

The distinction between "Prison Rules" and "Free Society Rules" is critical for modern jurisprudence.

1.  **For the Prisoner:** The inmate is under the authority of the state. Their path to "release" and a "new life" often involves submission and non-resistance to lawful authority (Prison Rules).

2.  **For the State/Military:** The entity responsible for the prisoner---and the safety of the public---cannot "turn the other cheek" to crime, terrorism, or invasion. It must execute judgment to maintain order.

**IV. Conclusion: A New Life**
------------------------------

We are releasing prisoners. This act requires a clear understanding of the transition from one legal status to another.

-   **Inside:** They survived by endurance (following prison rules/turning the cheek).

-   **Outside:** They must now survive by responsibility and the protection of their own life and liberty (the right to defense).

The theology of **Operation Restoring Valor** asserts that self-defense is a divine right for free people. We reject the notion that Christians or Veterans must be passive victims to foreign aggression. We follow the King who creates a whip of cords to clear the temple, not just the Lamb who went silent to the slaughter. We know the difference between the two missions.

**The Normal Rule is Justice against the Invader. The Exception is Submission within the Prison.**
